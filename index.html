							University Chicago as well as a B.F.A. in Digital Media from Kendall College of Art & Design. I'm very enthusiastic about both of these
							fields and I'm always looking for a challenge. I encourage you to scroll down to learn more about me.

							I began animating around the age of ten years old, starting with small GIF buddy icons for AOL Instant Messenger
							and then moving onto stick figure animation with Macromedia Flash 5 (now known as Adobe Animate). 
							<br>
							<br>
							In college, I started working on advanced character animation in the style of Looney Tunes. After graduating, 
							I shifted towards abstract animation to complement the music videos for the bands that I was in.
							I absolutely love animation and continue to push myself into new directions with it.

							Dancing has also been a longtime hobby of mine ever since I first learned how to moonwalk.
							Every so often, I make sure to head out and tear it up on the dance floor!
							<br>
							<br>
							Fun fact: In 2020, I passed the audition to be a contestant on season 17 of the network television show, 
							<em>"So You Think You Can Dance"</em>, but it was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
							<br>
							<br>
							By the time it came back, I was older than the 18-30 age range to be eligible to compete.ðŸ˜¢

							After working in I.T. for ten years, I became very familiar with all kinds of AV/conferencing systems.
							However, it just wasn't the right fit and I decided to go back to school to make a career shift into the
							world of code.
							<br>
							<br>
							From contributing to the open source Pencil2D animation program, to building this website, GUI apps,
							and a machine learning image classifier, I've become quite fond of programming over the last few years
							and am excited to make the jump into professional software engineering!
