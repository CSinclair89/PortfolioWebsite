# Portfolio Website

This is a very special project for me as it is a place for me to demonstrate my web design skills as well as showcase both my animated works and programming projects, all of which I'm proud of. Especially with the homepage, I wanted the user experience to result in a decent understanding of who I am and what kind of work I'm interested in.

## Goals

- Build a website to showcase not just an understanding of front-end web design, but also projects that I've worked on relevant to fields I'm passionate about: software engineering and animation.
- Utilize Javascript and CSS to implement minor animations that enhance the user experience of the homepage.
- Use CSS to make the website responsive on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Outcomes  

In finishing up this website, I realized two things:
- I'm very proud of how far I've come as a programmer in the last year.
- I have a whole lot more to learn!

Of all my GitHub repositories, I really wanted this project to showcase my artistic side as well as my tech side with a well-designed website. 
Even though there are plenty of areas in the CSS that I could definitely clean up and optimize, I do feel that I ultimately accomplished my goal in creating a strong portfolio website that a viewer would enjoy.
